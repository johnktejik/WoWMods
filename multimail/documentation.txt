type /multimail or click the button in the MailBox screen. Type a name and hit enter to add it to the list.  Click on anything in the list to remove it. 

'Tab' will take you to the List# box.  Type whatever list number (0-50) you want.  This makes for over 2500 names stored.

To actually send, the 'send mail' frame must be open, and you must have something written in either the subject or a body. Clicking Mutli Mail will then mail everyone in the list.

The buttons on the side put that group into the list.

The custom button brings up the customization screen.  
Note that race selection is very unreliable.  Race cannot be determined if the player is offline.  If a race cannot be determined, the race selections will be ignored for that player.
